exchangeable. For example, all railgun SMGs can
share ammo.
  The ammunition's Damage Value and Armor Pen-
etration modifiers are added to the weapon's base
DV and AP. With the exception of regular and armor-
piercing rounds, none of this ammunition may be
used with railguns. Listed costs are per 100 rounds
of ammunition.
  Armor-Piercing: This tungsten-carbide ammunition
penetrates armor effectively. [Low]
   Bug: Bug rounds are equipped with a microbug and
medical sensor nanobots. They attempt to gather in-
formation on the target's location (via standard mesh
tracking), health (querying the target's medichines),
and surroundings (typically hindered by being inside
the target's body). They will transmit status reports
in a pre-programmed manner via the mesh or a pre-
chosen frequency band either continuously or in pre-
set intervals. [Low]
   Capsule: Capsule ammo carries a payload (drug,
toxin, nanobots) that is released inside the target after
the round penetrates. [Trivial plus payload cost]
   Flux: Flux ammo is made from rheological materi-
als that allow each bullet to be “programmed” so that
they may change from regular rounds to less-lethal soft
plastic-like rounds. This allows the firer to choose the
type of round (regular or plastic) made with each shot
or burst, and then change with the next one. [Low]
