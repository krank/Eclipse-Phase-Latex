            Tai now has 1,000 points to customize. She wants to be
            lucky, so she starts right off spending 60 (4 x 15) CP to
            raise her Moxie from 1 to 5. She also decides that she
            wants her character to be better at spotting things, so
            she raises her INT from 15 to 20, at a cost of 50 CP (5 x
            10). So far, she's spent 110 CP.
               She must buy at least 400 points of Active skills, so she
            tackles that next. She knows that skills are based on apti-
            tudes and they get more expensive over 60, so she decides
            the most she'll spend on any single skill is 40 (since her
            highest aptitude is 20). She picks out her skills, assigns the
            points, and adds them to the starting aptitudes.
               This is what she starts with, noting the points she
            spent on each and the total value (counting aptitude)
            in parentheses.

            (45), Demolitions (COG) 40 (60), Fray (REF) 30 (50),
            Freefall (REF) 40 (60), Freerunning (SOM) 30 (45),

            Research (COG) 20 (40), and Scrounging (INT) 40 (60).
               This costs her 450 CP, so she's spent a total of 560
            CP so far.
               Now she spends her 300 points of Knowledge skills:
               Academics: Astrophysics (COG) 40 (60), Academics:
            Engineering (COG) 40 (60), Academics: Fall History

 than 5 psi-chi and 5 psi-gamma sleights may be bought
 during character creation.
    Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from
 sleights are treated as modifications; they are applied
 after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of
 buying skills or aptitudes during character creation.

 PURCHASE GEAR
 No matter what faction you are from, you use Credit
 to buy gear during character creation. A complete list
 of gear and costs can be found in the Gear chapter, p.
 294. The average costs for each cost category should
 be used when calculating gear prices.


                       GEAR COSTS
CATEGORY           RANGE (CREDITS)            AVERAGE (CREDITS)
Trivial                    1–99                          50
Low                      100–499                        250
Moderate                500–1,499                      1,000
High                   1,500–9,999                     5,000
Expensive                10,000+                      20,000
    This costs her another 350 CP, bringing her total spent
CP to 910.
    Adding in her background and faction skills, she also
has Networking: Autonomists (SAV) 30, Networking:
Hypercorps (SAV) 30, Pilot: Spacecraft (REF) 30 (50),
Pilot: Groundcraft (REF) 30 (50). She takes the freebie
+10 and adds it to Fray (raising it to 60) and applies the
other +10 to Academics: Economics (COG) 30.
    With 90 CP left, Tai moves on to Rep. Tai wants to
have a lot of good connections, so she raises both of her
Rep scores by 30 points each, at a cost of 6 CP. She also
decides she needs some credibility with criminal types,
so she buys g-rep at 40, for 4 more CP. Now she has 80
CP left.
    Tai's character needs a body, and she decides a
                                                              EXAMPLE



bouncer is most suited for the nomadic, spacefaring
lifestyle of her brinker. That costs another 40 CP, leaving
her with 50 CP left to spend.
    Looking back at her skills, she decides to raise her
Pilot: Spacecraft from 50 to 70. It costs her 10 CP to
raise the skill to 60, and another 20 CP to raise it from
60 to 70, for a total cost of 30 CP. She also wants to
raise her Scrounging from 60 to 70, for a 20 CP cost.
That nicely uses up the last of her CP.
    Scanning the traits, though, Tai also decides that
Situational Awareness would be a good choice for her
scavenger. At a cost of 10 CP, she would need to take an-
other negative trait to compensate. She chooses Neural
Damage (synaesthesia)—a condition she inherited from
a rampaging nanovirus during the Fall.
    Tai's points are now all evened out and spent.




     Every character starts off with one piece of gear
  for free: a standard muse (p. 332). This is the digital
  AI companion that the character has had since they
  were a child. Additionally, each character starts with 1
  month of backup insurance (p. 330) at no cost.
     There is no limitation other than what the game-
  master allows on what gear characters can and cannot
  buy during character creation. Both the players and
  gamemaster should keep the character's background
  and faction in mind. Since some gear is likely very
  restricted in some habitats if not outright illegal, there
  needs to be a plausible explanation for who and how
  a character from such a place might have such gear.
  If there isn't, then the gamemaster can choose not to
  allow it. The starting locale for a game should also
  be considered. A character from the restrictive Jovian
  Republic might have a hard time explaining how they
  have an illegal cornucopia machine back in the Re-
  public, but if the game takes place on board a scum
  barge where everything is available and anything goes,
  then such an explanation becomes much easier.
     Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from gear
  are treated as modifications; they are applied after
  all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying
  skills or aptitudes during character creation.
