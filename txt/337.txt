 KINETIC WEAPONS
 Kinetic weapons damage the target by firing a hard
 impact projectile at high-velocities. Slugthrowers
 have evolved from the mechanical firearms of the
 early 21st century, however, and now fall into two
 categories: chemical firearms and railguns. Though
 their mechanisms for firing are different, they are
 roughly similar in effect. Railguns have a higher
 penetration and inflict more damage, which is offset
 by more limited ammunition choices. While modern
 beam weapons have their uses, they rarely match the
 punch of kinetic weapons, therefore slugthrowers
 are still perceived as the most versatile and effective
 weapon system.
   Kinetic weapons are constructed from lightweight,
 reinforced plastoceramic materials, which are easily
 produced even without nanofabrication. By default,
 modern kinetic weapons are ambidextrous but more
 importantly feature safety and smartlink systems (p.
 342) that automatically connect to the wielder's mesh
 inserts for firing assistance, target recognition, and
 tactical networking.
   The wielder of a firearm or railgun uses Kinetic
 Weapons skill. For information on firing modes, see
 p. 198. For different ammunition types, see p. 336.
 Ranges are listed on p. 203.

 FIREARMS
 Modern chemical firearms use caseless ammuni-
 tion that is auto-loaded from a magazine. They are

      Note that older, pre-Fall firearms still exist and are
   traded by black marketeers, though they use outdated
   system such as liquid propellants or cased ammuni-
   tion. At the gamemaster's discretion, these relics may
   suffer shorter ranges, less penetration, fewer firing
   modes, or reduced damage.
      Pistols: Pistols are small-sized (p. 297) and de-
   signed for one-hand use. Light pistols sacrifice pene-
   trating ability for concealability. Heavy pistols focus
   on stopping power, with medium pistols occupying
   a middle ground. All versions fire in semi-automatic,
   burst-fire, and full-auto modes. [Low]
      Submachine Guns: SMGs use pistol ammuni-
   tion, but are medium-sized (p. 297) and may fire in
   semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes. They typi-
   cally are designed in a bullpup configuration for
   close quarters operations and are ideal for tactical
   and strike teams. [Moderate]
      Automatic Rifles: Automatic rifles use rifle ammu-
   nition and have greater range and penetration than
   SMGs. They fire in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto
   modes. They are two-handed weapons. [Moderate]
      Sniper Rifle: Sniper rifles are optimized for range,
   accuracy, penetration, and stopping power. They fire
   in semi-auto, burst fire, or full auto modes, and are
   two-handed weapons. [High]
