                             DICE:
pse Phase uses percentile dice—d100,
 or two ten-sided dice (d10s) ■ p. 114




     MAKING TESTS:
     All tests are d100 rolls, trying to roll under or equal to a target number. The target number is determined
     by your skill rating, with modifiers applied depending on how difficult the task is. 00 is always a success;
     99 always a failure. ■ p. 115
