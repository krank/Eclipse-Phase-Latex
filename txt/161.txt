Despite the failures of statist capi-     or pirating nanofab blue
talism, you're a die-hard believer in     an age of automated m
free markets—and when markets             you're a damn good pilot
aren't free, you have no qualms           can talk or shoot your w
about undermining them.                   messy situations. Where
   You make a living supplying the        people look down on synt
inner system and Jovian black mar-        you embrace the post-biol
kets, whether that means running          and its freedom from chem
blockades, smuggling contraband,          biological dependencies.■
