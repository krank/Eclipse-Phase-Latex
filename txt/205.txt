 as doors, walls, etc. This reflects the fact that most
 ranged attacks simply penetrate the structure, leaving
 minor damage.
   Agonizers and stunners have no effect on objects
 and structures.

 SHOOTING THROUGH
 If a character attempts to shoot through an object or
 structure at a target on the other side, the attack is
 likely to suffer a blind fire modifier of at least –30
 unless the attack has some way of viewing the target.
 On top of this, the target receives an armor bonus
 equal to the object/structure's Armor rating x 2.

 RANGE
Every type of ranged weapon has a limited range,
beyond which it is ineffective. The effective range of
the weapon is further broken down into four catego-
ries: Short, Medium, Long, and Extreme. A modifier
is applied for each category, as noted on the Combat
Modifiers table, p. 193.
   For examples of specific weapon ranges, see the
Weapon Ranges table.

 RANGE, GRAVITY, AND VACUUM
 The ranges listed on the Weapon Ranges table are for
 Earth-like gravity conditions (1 g). While the effective
 ranges of kinetic, seeker, spray, and thrown weapons
 can potentially increase in lower gravity environments
 due to lack of gravitational forces or aerodynamic
 drag, accuracy is still the defining factor for determin-
 ing whether you hit or miss a target. In lower gravi-
 ties, use the same effective ranges listed, but extend
 the maximum range by dividing it by the gravity (for
 example, a max range of 100 meters would be 200
 meters in 0.5 g). In microgravity and zero g, the maxi-
 mum range is effectively line of sight. Likewise, under
 high-gravity conditions (over 1 g), divide each range
 category maximum by the gravity (e.g., a short range
 of 10 meters would be 5 meters in 2 g).
    Beam weapons are not affected by gravity, but they
 do fare much better in non-atmospheric conditions.
 Maximum beam weapon range in vacuum is effec-
 tively line of sight.
