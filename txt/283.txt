   Clusters are most commonly found in volatile-rich env
like the Trojans and the ring systems of the gas giants (p
Saturn). Clusters are rare in the Jovian system because

Jupiter's intense magnetosphere is hideously inefficient.

COLE BUBBLES
Cole bubbles (or “bubbleworlds”) are found mostly in
asteroid belt, where the large nickel-iron asteroids used t
them are abundant. Bubbleworlds are less common in t
and Greeks, where crusty ice asteroids predominate. A C
is similar in many respects to an O'Neill cylinder, but th
longitudinal windows. Sunlight instead enters through a
arrays. The bubbleworld is also constructed very differen
large solar array to heat a pocket of water inside of a met
so that the metal expands. Rotating the asteroid caus
leable material to form a cylinder, which is then capped
water drained. The inside can then be pressurized, bui
planted. Cole bubbles can also be spun for gravity, accor

poles of the bubble, with zero gravity at the axis of rotat
   Cole bubbles are among the largest structures transhu
created in space. The largest Cole habitat, Extropia, ha

HAMILTON CYLINDERS
Hamilton cylinders are a new technology. There are only
operational Hamilton cylinders in the system, but the de
great promise and is likely to be widely adopted over t
period. Hamilton cylinders are grown using a comple
algorithm that orchestrates nanoscale building machi
nanobots build the habitat slowly over time, a process
growing than construction.
   Similar to O'Neill cylinders and Cole bubbles, a Ham
der is a cylindrical habitat rotating on its long axis to pr

O'NEILL CYLINDERS
Found mostly in the orbits of Earth, Luna, Venus, and Ma
cylinders were among transhumanity's first large space
signs. O'Neill cylinders are no longer built, having bee
by more efficient designs, but are still home to tens of
transhumans. O'Neill cylinders were constructed from me
on Luna or Mercury, Lunar volatiles (including Lunar
and asteroidal silicates.
  A typical O'Neill habitat is thirty-five kilometers lon
lometers in diameter, and rotates around its long axis
sufficient for centrifugal force to create one Earth grav
