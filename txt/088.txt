SYSTEM GAZETEER
Transhumanity has extended out from its lost home-
world and colonized not only the solar system but var-
ious exoplanets as well, thanks to the discovery of the
Pandora Gates. This section provides an overview and
incomplete sampling of transhumanity's settlements.

SOL (THE SUN)
The solar system was formed billions of years ago
through the accretion of material remaining from the
formation of its star, Sol, the sun. Locked ever since in
its orbit, the history and present disposition of virtu-
ally every object within two light years is shaped by
its relationship to this body. The sun is a bright G2
main sequence star, theoretically on the hot end of the
continuum of stars able to give rise to life. For most
of its history, transhumanity fueled its rises and falls
with the sun's energy, first as stored in materials like
hydrocarbons, later directly with solar converters.
   Today the sun remains a crucial source of energy,
but its outer reaches have also become home to
some. The adaptations required to dwell here make
these suryas one of transhumanity's most unusual
offshoots.

SURYAS AND SALAMANDERS (CORONAL MORPHS)
Perhaps an example of transhumanity's most extreme
neogenetic creations are the morphs adapted to live
in the sun's corona. Suryas, named after a Hindu sun
deity, are large, whale-like, and uniquely adapted to
dwell in the brilliant, superheated plasma cloud of the
sun's outermost layer. Each surya is like a miniature
version of a circumsolar habitat. Their metabolisms
generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them
from the sun's heat and radiation, while acting as
magnetic sails and scoops by which they sail on the
currents of the solar wind and extract elements carried
on it. Suryas are protected by layers of liquid water
“blubber” that capture harmful ions, which internal
medichines extract and eject, while maintaining useful
elements such as oxygen and hydrogen, from which
more water can be synthesized. They communicate
using patterns of dark and light coloration on their
exterior skins and are extremely sensitive to the he-
lioseismic soundwaves that are the sun's pulse, using
these vibrations to predict and avoid heavy weather in
the coronal atmosphere.
   A second type of coronal morph is the salamander,
a tiny humanoid morph with gas jets on the back and
chest for maneuvering in vacuum. Salamanders have
very similar metabolisms to suryas, but are unable to
survive unprotected in the corona. They subsist on the
chemicals and energy extracted from the corona by
Ukko Jylina, the only habitat where they are found.
   Both suryas and salamanders communicate
either via transmissions from their implants or by
“sunspotting”—shifting dark and light patterns on
their skins to form language.
HABITATS
Habitats in Sol's corona face challenges more extreme
than those faced by habs anywhere else in the system.
Transhumanity's only means of shielding a habitat
from the heat and radiation emitted by a G2 star is to
generate strong electromagnetic fields. Even then, the
dangers posed by solar flares and coronal mass ejec-
tions—massive explosions that jettison coronal material
tens of thousands of kilometers out into circumsolar
space—mean that the Sun's polar regions are the only
safe space in which to position habitats. As such, cir-
cumsolar habs require extraordinary expense to build
and maintain, and two of the three major circumsolar
habitats are heavily backed by distant organizations.
   The outer layers of circumsolar habitats are covered
with thousands of electromagnetic dynamos drawing
power from the sun itself. These dynamos generate
the powerful fields necessary for shielding. Within
are intermediate layers filled with liquid water that
captures ionized particles, teeming with nanites that
collect the ions and vent them into space. The water
must be regularly replaced from captured iceteroids
that are imported using heavy electromagnetic shield-
ing of their own. Within the water shield is a cluster
habitat, an array of modules on a framework follow-
ing a roughly spherical plan.




 A QUICK PRIMER ON
 TRANSHUMAN HABITATS
  Habitats are covered in detail on p. 280. A quick overview is
    provided here:
  - Aerostats are massive cities floating in the upper cloud
    layers of Venus.
  - Beehives are tunnel warrens inside asteroids and moons.
  - Clusters are microgravity habitats consisting of intercon-
    nected modules.
  - Cole bubble habitats are hollowed-out asteroids, ter-
    raformed on the inside, and also spun for gravity.
  - Dome habitats are massive domes built on the surface of
    moons, asteroids, or Mars.
  - Hamilton cylinders are self-building advanced nano-
    tech habitats designs.
  - O'Neill cylinder habitats are like large soda cans, only
    huge, over a kilometer wide and several kilometers long.
    The interior is terraformed and the entire cylinder is spun
    for light gravity. O'Neill cylinders are sometimes paired
    together, end to end.
  - Reagan cylinders are an inefficient type of O'Neill
    cylinder, built by hollowing a cylinder within a spinning
    asteroid, and used in the Jovian Republic.
  - Tin can habitats are small, cramped, cheap, modular
    boxes, typically used in early space colonization.
  - Torus habitats are big donuts or wheels, spun so that the
    outer rim has gravity. The interior spokes are zero-G.  ■
