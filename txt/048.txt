  LIVING WITH INFOTECH
  For anyone with basic mesh inserts (p. 300) or an ecto
  (meaning about ninety-six percent of the population),
  life is filled with data. For people with the best im-
  plants, all information available on the mesh is avail-
  able at a thought. For everyone else, it only requires a
  brief pause to access and understand it. When some-
  one pauses and looks a bit distracted in the midst of a
  conversation, everyone understands they are accessing
  data and lack the implants to allow them to do this
  subconsciously or via multi-tasking. As a result, when
  a group of people are discussing a topic and no one
  immediately knows an answer to a question, such as
  the title of a performer's first vid, within a few seconds
