APTITUDE COMPARISON:
FLATS VS. SPLICERS AND EXALTS
Compared to humans in the early 21st Century, the average transhuman in the world of Eclipse Phase is faster,
smarter, stronger, and healthier than their unaugmented predecessors. Normal unaugmented humans, called
flats (p. 139), most closely approximate the type of person that was born in our time. The majority of people,
however, inhabit bodies that are known as splicers (p. 139) or exalts (p. 139) (well, those with biological bodies
anyway). Splicers are genefixed to avoid genetic defects and optimized for certain characteristics, while exalts
are tweaked to make them superior across the board: they are more attractive, more athletic, have greater
cognitive capacity, and are more attuned to the world around them than their unaugmented kin.                   ■
