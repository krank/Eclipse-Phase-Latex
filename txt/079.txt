from Earth, scientists and technicians who
didn't appreciate being on a corporate           CALL F
leash, indentured vacworkers who sought
to escape their oppressive terms of service,
and even criminals fleeing hypercorp jus-
tice or forcibly expelled from inner system
habitats. Their ranks swelled with every
act of inner system injustice, though life
on the fringe was often harsh and deadly.
Despite occasional hostilities with nation-
state military units or hypercorp security,
the expense of reining in these radicals and
expats was too high. To some degree, their
presence was useful to the powers-that-be.
   Breakthroughs with nanofabrication
brought these libertines and fringers the
edge they needed to keep their autonomy
over the long-term. Once cornucopia
machines were widely available, anyone
had the means to support and defend
themselves without relying on outside or
higher authorities. Already an outpost for
open source and free culture activists who
fought restrictions on ideas, media, and
digital content, the outer system became
a haven for sharing nanofab designs and
circumventing the controls the hypercorps
attempted to place on their software and
other digital goods.

The stations and swarms adhering to these
ideas have bonded together under a loose
autonomist alliance, a mutual aid pact
to help each other in times of crisis and
present a united front against the inner
system powers and Jovian Junta. There is
little formal structure to this alliance as an
entity unto itself; it primarily exists as an
assortment of joint resolutions agreed to
by its various member habitats and a few
ad hoc task forces dedicated to address-
ing a particular problem or issue and then
dissolving. Delegated ambassadors act
as negotiators with outside powers, but
these have limited authority and are held
strictly accountable.

         Check this out. Residents of the autono-
      mist Red Jupiter habitat just put out a call
      for support and solidarity from @-listers
      in the regional neighborhood. Appar-
      ently the station's citizen councils granted
      asylum to a group of AGIs seeking refuge
      from Jovian Republic counter-AI ops. The
      Junta has labeled the AGIs as dangerous
      criminals researching upgrades that would
      propel them to seed AI status, contrary
      to system-wide resolutions. The AGIs are
      claiming that they escaped from a secret
      Jovian research project. They say they pur-
      sued self-programming research to bypass
      Jovian-inflicted restrictions that violated
      their rights as autonomous and sentient
      entities and that they are facing persecu-
      tion due to anti-AI biases. This could be a
      chance for us to kick some Jovian ass and
      look into non-standard AGI programming
      at the same time. You in?
