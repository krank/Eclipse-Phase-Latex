HEADHUNTERS
Headhunters are multi-legged insectoid flying drones
that use a dragonfly wing configuration to hover and
move. The legs are equipped with grasping claws
and extendable buzzsaws. Their primary purpose is
to grasp on to the heads of victims and cut through
the neck, decapitating them. Collected heads are then
flown to nearby special facilities for forced uploading.

HUNTER-KILLERS
  These lethal flying drones achieved air superiority
during TITAN military operations. Their sleek jet-
powered form unfolds for vectored-thrust hovering
and weapons deployment.

WARBOTS
Warbots are massive, armored, vaguely anthropo-
morphic mecha, used for heavy combat operations.
Bipedal, these warbots are equipped with four arms
and a pair of grasping mechanical tentacles, along
with numerous weapon systems.

SELF-REPLICATING NANOSWARMS
The nanoswarms distributed by the TITANs are a step
beyond the nanotechnology available to transhumanity.
Unlike transhuman-created nanoswarms, the TITAN
swarms are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating.
They are also highly adaptive, meaning they are not
single function but can modify themselves to perform
almost any nanoswarm task. They may also nano-
fabricate new materials, much like fractals (p. 382).
Combined, these capabilities make such nanoswarms
incredibly potent. When they encounter a new op-
ponent, they can scan the opponent's capabilities and
then fabricate offensive systems to use against them.
When an opponent deploys a weapon system again the
swarm, it will learn and adapt countermeasures that
will make such attacks ineffective against the swarm in
the future. These nanoswarms may also function like
so-called utility fog, linking together into a physical
lattice in order to create large scale physical forms.
   The possibilities for such nanoswarms are almost lim-
itless. For example, they may lie in wait as an invisible
nanoscopic swarm, float as barely-visible mist, or shape
into a swarm of small hopping drones to move about.
When facing opponents, the nanoswarm could transform
itself into a giant electroshock net across the ground,
shape into a flotilla of seeker-armed flying drones, or
link together as a set of massive whip-like tentacles to
slice through their fleshy foes. Such nanoswarms are
also impossible to destroy, as only a few nanobots need
to survive in order to rebuild the swarm, and the new
swarm will learn from the mistakes of the old.
   Self-replicating nanoswarms follow the rules given
for Nanoswarms and Microswarms, p. 328, with the
following additions and exceptions:

  - They do not need to be sustained by a hive and
    do not deteriorate.
  - They self-repair damage at the rate of 1d10 per
    half hour.
  - They may nanofabricate new items, materials,
    or forms in half the standard timeframe (half an
    hour per Cost category).
  - They may replicate any of the nanoswarm func-
    tions as noted on p. 328, as well as the functions
    of any other nanoswarm-using gear (smart dust,
    covert ops tool, repair spray, etc.).
  - They may make SOM Tests.
  - At the gamemaster's discretion, they may adapt
    new defenses against attacks used against them.
    New defenses take a minimum of 2 hours to devise
    and replicate throughout the swarm, after which
    such an attack will inflict minimal or no damage.
  - Assume they have any skill they need at a mini-
    mum of 40. Such skills may rapidly improve
    as needed.
