operatives exists for this purpose). [Low to Moderate
per month]
   Body Bank: People who are egocasting to another
station but whom hope to download back into the
same body they have before when they return may
put the morph on ice for the duration of their absence.
[Moderate per month]
   Bot/Pod Rental: When you need a helping hand or
a personal companion for a day or two, renting a bot
or pod is often the way to go. [Moderate per day]
   Egocasting: This is the use of a farcaster to trans-
mit an ego/infomorph. Farcasting is not cheap, and
the cost is impacted by factors such as distance to
receiver station and priority service (paying extra to
get bumped ahead in line). [Expensive]
   Fake Ego ID: This forged ID will pass in most inner
system and Jovian Republic habitats, and sometimes
others. [High]
   Morph Brokerage: Acquiring a new morph is not
always easy and is affected by factors such as the type
of morph, sought-after enhancements/customizations,
and local availability. Numerous brokerage services
exist to find you what you need, or close to it. With
enough lead-time, it may be possible to grow a pod
that closely imitates your morph of choice. A willing-
ness to accept used/traded-in morphs helps to reduce
costs. For more details, see Morph Brokerage, p. 276.
   Psychosurgery: A character can purchase time in an
immersive high-fidelity simulspace with expert care
from psychosurgeons and AIs in order to cope with
derangements and disorders that build up as a result
of existing in a transhuman universe. For an addi-
tional price the procedure can be time shifted to speed
up the relative time within the simulspace. For more
details, see Mental Healing and Psychotherapy, p. 215,
and Psychosurgery, p. 229. [Moderate per month]
   Simulspace Subscription: This will by you access to
the simulspace of your choice, whether you want it for
a private meeting/vacation or to play the latest and
hottest VR game. [Low (single use/1 day) to Moderate
(monthly subscription)]
   Space Travel: Space transport cost depends on a
number of factors like distance, quality of lodgings,
and how much cargo you're bringing with. At the low
end, an intra-habitat shuttle trip within the same clus-
ter, or a trip to or from a planetary body's surface and
orbit, is not cheap but affordable [High]. Just about
anything else is progressively more costly. [Expensive]
SOFTWARE
For information on using software, see the Mesh chap-
ter, p. 234.

PROGRAMS
These programs can be run on any computerized device.
   AR Illusions: These databases of AR clips can be used
to create realistic illusions in someone's entoptic display.
See Augmented Reality Illusions, p. 259. [Moderate]
   Exploit: Exploits are hacker tools that take advan-
tage of known vulnerabilities in other software. They
are required for intrusion attempts (p. 254). [High]
   Facial/Image Recognition: This program can be
used to take an image and run a pattern-matching
search among public archives. Similar version of this
program exist for other biometrics: gait recognition,
vocal recognition, etc. [Low]
   Firewall: This program protects a device from
hostile intrusion. Every system comes with a standard
version of this software by default. [Low]
   Sniffer: Sniffer programs collect all of the transmis-
sion that pass to, from, or through the device they are
running on. See Sniffing, p. 252. [Moderate]
   Spoof: Spoof is a hacker tool used to fake com-
mands and transmissions, making them seem as if
they came from another source. See Spoofing Authen-
tication, p. 255. [Moderate]
   Tactical Networks: These programs allow people in
the same squad to share tactical data in real-time. See
Tactical Networks, p. 205. [Moderate]
   Tracking: This software is used to track people by
their presence online. See Scanning, Tracking, and
Monitoring, p. 251. [Moderate]
   XP: Experience playback recordings are clips of
someone else's experiences. Depending on the content,
some XP (porn, snuff, crime, etc.) may be restricted in
certain jurisdictions. Some XP clips are intentionally
modified so that their emotive tracks are more intense,
giving the viewer a greater thrill. [Low to High]

AIS AND MUSES
Every character starts with a personal muse for free.
Many devices also come with pre-installed AIs, ca-
pable of helping the user, responding to commands, or
even operating the device on their own. Rules for AIs
can be found on p. 264.
   Below are some commonly available AI programs.
Unless otherwise noted, these AIs have aptitudes of 10.
These AIs may also be equipped with skillsofts (p. 332).
   Bot/Vehicle AI: These AIs are designed to be capa-
ble of piloting the robot/vehicle without transhuman
assistance. REF 20. Skills: Hardware: Electronics 20,
Infosec 20, Interests: [Bot/Vehicle] Specs 80, Interface
40, Research 20, Perception 40, Pilot: [appropriate
field] 40. [High]
   Device AI: These AIs are designed to operate a par-
ticular device without transhuman assistance. Skills:
Infosec 20, Interests: [Device] Specs 80, Interface 30
(Device Specialization), Programming 20, Research 20,
Perception 20. [Moderate]
