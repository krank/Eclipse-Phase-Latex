CHOOSE MOTIVATIONS
The next step is to choose 3 personal motivations
 for your character (see Motivations, p. 121). These
 are memes, in the form of ideologies or goals, which
your character is pursuing. These may be as specific
“undermine the local triad boss” or as broad as “pro-
 mote hypercapitalism,” and they may be short term
 or long term. Some sample motivations are provided
 on the Example Motivations table (p. 138). You
 should work with your gamemaster when choosing
your motivations, as they can be used to propel the
 storyline forward and specific scenarios can be con-
 structed around your character's goals. Some of your
 character's motivations may change later (see Chang-
 ing Motivation, p. 152). Motivations will help your
 character regain Moxie (p. 122) and earn extra Rez
 Points during gameplay (p. 384).
    Motivations should be listed on your character
 sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with a +
 or – symbol to denote whether they support or oppose
 it. For example, “+Fame” would indicate that your
 character seeks to become a famous media personality,
 whereas “–Reclaim Earth” means that your character
 opposes the goal of reclaiming Earth.

FINAL TOUCHES
Now that you have everything settled, there are a few
final steps.

REMAINING STATS
A few stats now need to be calculated and added to
your character sheet:

 - Lucidity (p. 122) equals your character's WIL x 2.
 - Trauma Threshold (p. 122) equals your LUC
   divided by 5 (round up).
 - Insanity Rating (p. 122) equals LUC x 2.
 - Initiative (p. 121) equals your character's (REF +
   INT) x 2.
 - Damage Bonus (p. 123) for melee equals SOM ÷
   10 (round down).
 - Death Rating (p. 122) equals DUR x
   1.5 (biomorphs, round up) or DUR x 2
   (synthmorphs)
 - Speed (p. 121) equals 1 (3 for infomorphs), modi-
   fied as appropriate by implants.
