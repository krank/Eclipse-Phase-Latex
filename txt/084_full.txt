RECLAIMERS
Memes: Reclaiming Earth

The Reclaimers pursue one ultimate goal—the recla-
mation of Earth as transhumanity's primary habitat.
In addition to calling for the quarantine of earth to be
lifted, they engage in scientific research and running
virtual simulations on how to best cleanse and reclaim
their contaminated and polluted planet. Despite the
interdiction to enter Earth's atmosphere, the reclaim-
ers are suspected of sponsoring perilous and high-risk
ventures onto the planet's surface to gather scientific
data or event to establish terraforming colonies.                The ultimates advocate the use of applied eugen-
