LEARNING NEW SKILLS                                 cha
Similarly, to learn a new skill, the character      ing
must actively study/practice and/or seek            ove
instruction. No test to learn is required,          of
unless the period of study was hampered             tha
or in some way deficient, in which case the         effo
gamemaster may call for a COG x 3 Test              Rez
to pick up the new skill. Otherwise, once a         bon
character has spent approximately a week            neg
learning a new skill, they may purchase their       no
first skill point at the usual cost (1 RP). The
skill is bought up from the aptitude rating,        IM
per normal. Once a new skill is acquired, it is      Re
raised according to the standard rules above.        cre

At the gamemaster's discretion, both positive
and negative traits may be acquired or lost         IM
during gameplay, though such changes should         Ch
be rare and only made in accordance with the        ma
