 solar system in a matter of days or weeks, instead of
 weeks or months.
    Anti-matter drive fast couriers are vessels de-
 signed for this specific purpose. This vessel can
 travel from Venus to Mars in a week and from
 Mars to Jupiter in a month. The fast courier is the
 swiftest vessels currently made and is able to reach
 at much as one half of one percent of the speed
 of light. To manage this, this spacecraft must also
 carry 6 tons of antimatter in a 100 ton magnetic
 containment vessel. In an emergency, this contain-
 ment facility can be jettisoned.
    Destroyer: One of the largest military spacecraft
 in common use, destroyers use an antimatter drive
 holding 150 tons of antimatter in a 2,000-ton mag-
 netic containment vessel. This antimatter can also
 be used to provide the spacecraft's missiles with
 anti-matter for devastatingly powerful anti-matter
 warheads. This spacecraft is also armed with
 railguns, nuclear and high explosive missiles, and
 point defense lasers.  In addition, all destroyers
 carry a contingent of 20 fighters.
    Fighter: This small, short range military vessel is de-
 signed to be crewed by an infomorph or AI. If needed,
 however, it can hold a single synthmorph or vaccum-
 adapted biomorph as a pilot. It carries 3 lasers and 2
 railguns mounted on small pods placed around the
 middle of ship that can fire in any direction. A single
 missile launcher is located in the nose of the fighter
 and typically holds 6 small high explosive missiles or
 tactical nuclear missiles (or even anti-matter missiles
 if facing high-threat targets).
    General Exploration Vehicle (GEV): A GEV is one
 of the standard vehicles used for exploration beyond
 the Pandora Gates. It is specifically designed to handle
 almost any environment. It is a boxy vehicle, 6 meters
 long, 2.2 meters wide, and 2 meters high. It makes
 extensive use of smart matter in the lower part of the
 chassis, and can create wheels or short legs (primar-
 ily useful for exceedingly rough terrain). It can even
 produce limited hull streamlining and propulsion

 suitable for travel both on and underwater. In addi-
 tion, it contains a small metallic hydrogen engine that
 allow it to maneuver in space with an acceleration of
 up to 0.1 G. GEVs have a Maximum Velocity of 200
 (wheeled)/40 (walker)/60 (sea)/40 (submerged).
    The GEV also has a closed cycle life support system
 that can support up to 6 (fairly cramped) living
 occupants for up to one month and limited electro-
 magnetic shielding against charged particle radiation.
 All models are fitted with advanced AI piloting and
 navigation as well as limited self-repair capacity. In
 addition, GEV's have an extensible airlock, a single
 healing vat, several desktop CMs, and a variety of
 sensors, including both radar and telescopic full spec-
 trum cameras.
    Large Lander and Orbit Transfer Vehicle (LLOTV):
 This common vehicle is used for transporting passen-
 gers and cargo between a planet or moon and orbit
 and for short distance transfers between habitats
 less than 100,000 km apart. This conical vehicle has
 a curved heat shield on the base and smart material
 landing legs and grapples so that it can rest securely
 on any stable terrain and link up with all forms of
 docking clamps. It comes in variants designed to use
 either a hydrogen-oxygen chemical rocket or a me-
 tallic hydrogen rocket. The use of light-weight smart
 materials allows the interior to be easily and rapidly
 reconfigured to accommodate different amounts of
 fuel, passenger seats, and cargo space. LLOTVs that
 are not designed for planetary landing or which are
 designed only to land on airless moons are unstream-
 lined and look considerably blockier.
    LLOTVs come in two configurations: high or low
 velocity. High velocity configuration allows the vehicle
 to land and take off again on Venus or Earth without
 refueling and for rapid transport between nearby
 habitats. Low velocity configuration is designed to
 land and take off again on Mars or various large
 moons without refueling and for slower and more
 fuel efficient transport between nearby habitats. The
 extensive use of smart materials in this vehicle means
