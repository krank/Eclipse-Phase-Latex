 them like a frisbee, after which they propel themselves
 with an ionic drive (p. 310). Saucers make excellent
“eye in the sky” monitors and scouts. [Low]
    Servitor: Servitors are the most common robot,
 acting as cooks, janitors, universal helpers, movers,
 and personal aides. Every home has one, if not several.
 Servitors are intentionally built in non-humanoid
 forms so as not to confuse them with common
 synthmorphs and in order to defuse bad feelings at
 ordering them around. However, they all have some
 form of “face” to interact with, so as not to be too
 machine-like. [Low]
    Speck: Specks are tiny insectoid spy drones, 2.5 mm
 long and 2 mm wide, about the size of a small fruit fly.
They fly with tiny wings, carry a microbug, and are
 excellent for surveillance purposes or otherwise being
 a “speck on a wall.” Specks are difficult to notice (–30
 Perception modifier) and almost impossible to distin-
 guish from an actual insect. [Low]

 SPACECRAFT
 Though egocasting is a common method of personal
 transport and it's often easier to simply transmit the
 specifications for various goods and to allow nano-
 factories to create duplicates, spacecraft play an
 important role in the solar system, carrying both pas-
 sengers and valuable cargo. Both in terms of materials
 and propulsion, spacecraft in the post-Fall era are far
 superior to the primitive vessels used in the 20th and
 early 21st centuries, but they are still based on the
 same principles.

      Spacecraft have few stats in Eclipse Phase, as they
    are primarily handled as setting rather than vehicles.
    Note also that no stats are given for spacecraft weap-
    onry. It is highly recommended that space combat be
    handled as a plot device rather than a combat scene,
    given the extreme lethality and danger involved.
