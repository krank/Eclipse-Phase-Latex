  SKILL RANGES
  What is the difference between being a clumsy neo-
  phyte wobbling in zero gravity and being a veteran
  gliding effortlessly through space as though you were
  dancing? The answer is training and skill. The greater
  your skill, the more likely you are to not only succeed
  at what you want to do, but succeed well.
    Aptitudes in Eclipse Phase range from 1 to 30,
  while learned skills range from 0 to 99. These num-
  bers are an abstraction of the range of transhuman
  abilities and traits. The Aptitude Range table provides
  a breakdown of different aptitude levels and how they
  relate to each other. Likewise, the Learned Skill Range
  table provides an interpretation for the capabilities at
  different skill levels.



  APTITUDES
  There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase, described on p.
  123. Each character has these aptitudes at a minimum
  rating of 1.

  APTITUDE-ONLY TESTS
  In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude
  only, rather than a learned skill. This should only
  occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the
  test, and these circumstances are usually noted in
  the rules.
    Aptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as
  the range of aptitude ratings (1–30) is typically much
  smaller than the rating of learned skills (0–99). For
  this reason, most aptitude tests should use a target
  number equal to the aptitude x 3. In rare cases where

   the test is more difficult, the gamemaster may simply
   use an aptitude x 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.
   In some cases, more than one aptitude may be rel-
   evant to the test, and so they may be added together
   to derive the target number.
     What follows are a few examples where an aptitude-
   only test might be appropriate. Gamemasters may call
   for similar tests in other situations, but learned skills
   should be used whenever possible.
