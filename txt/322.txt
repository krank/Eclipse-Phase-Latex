  Comfurt: This tasty yogurt treat blocks stress hor-
mones, stabilizes mood, and relieves anxiety, allowing
them to ignore the effect of 1 trauma and temporarily
boosting Lucidity by +5. Any stress suffered while the
drug is in effect is taken from the bonus Lucidity first.
Comfurt also provides a +10 bonus when resisting
attempts to manipulate the user's emotions. Excessive
use of Comfurt can lead to chronic itchiness caused by
histamine release. [Low]

RECREATIONAL DRUGS
These drugs compete with petals (p. 321) and black
market XP for wasting people's time and lives away.
   Buzz: This gene-modified variant of BZ is an odor-
less, invisible, extremely powerful hallucinogen. Users
or affected characters will undergo extremely realistic
hallucinations for the duration, and may even “share”
hallucinations with other affected characters. Charac-
ters will suffer a –30 modifier to any tests to remember
what occurred while under the influence. [Moderate]
   Mono No Aware: Taken from the Japanese term
for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this
drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that
induces a meditative state. Mono No Aware gives the
character a +10 bonus on Art and Sense Tests. With
frequent use, Mono No Aware reacts with pigments
in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge,
even in darker-skinned morphs. [Low]
   Orbital Hash: Good ol' reefer—but grown in space
using powerful lighting and post-singularity hydropon-
ics. Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum
barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of

 transport and delivery. However, for the wealthy and
 on planets, buds in leaf form are not uncommon. Hash
 allows the character to ignore the effects of 1 trauma,
 but inflicts a –10 penalty on all memory-related tests

 SOCIAL DRUGS
 These social lubricants affect the user's interactions
 with others.
   Alpha: Alpha is a more subtle version of BringIt,
 popular with hypercorp execs, street thugs, and
 anyone else who wants to come across as a domineer-
 ing asshole. The pharm designer who invented it had
 a retro sensibility (and maybe a sick sense of humor);
 Alpha is typically synthesized as a sparkling white
 powder designed to be snorted. Alpha stimulates
 production of threat pheromones, but less bluntly
 than BringIt. Alpha imparts confidence, a feeling of
 power, and alertness. Users can function without sleep
 for 4 days, after which point they need to catch up
 with at least 4 hours of sleep (remember morphs with
 basic biomods require less sleep). Dosed characters
 receive a +20 modifier on Intimidation Tests and +10
 on Persuasion and Networking Tests where attitude is
 a factor (gamemaster discretion). These bonuses only
 apply to characters within 2 meters of the Alpha user.
   On the downside, alpha users are impatient, unfo-
 cused assholes. At the gamemaster's discretion, Social
 skill modifiers may be reversed to penalties with
 certain types of people. Additionally, Alpha users
 suffer –10 on all COG skill tests related to memory
